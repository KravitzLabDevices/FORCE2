# FORCE2
FORCE2 is an arduino-based, open-source device for home-cage operant training. This repository includes all the code and documentation needed to run the device. For all information regarding the printing, and assembly of the device click here (add link). FORCE2 source code is written in C++ and all the examples are written in Arduino (itself a superset of C++). 

## About this repository
This repository contains all the source code and examples for different behavioral paradigms. The wiki is the main resource for both instructions on how to flash the code in your device once assembled and code documentation.
If you find any bugs in the code or have any enhancement requests, please open an Issue on this repository. 

## Flexibility of FORCE2
One of the main goals of FORCE2 is to be highly flexible. The FORCE2 library has been develop to be able to control many variables in the device, home-cage training of many behavioral paradigms. The following are some examples of behavioral paradigms that can be implemented on FORCE2:

## Future goals
In future versions, we hope to include a sleep function that increases the battery efficiency of the device.
